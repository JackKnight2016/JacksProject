<p>We met Lizzie at the British Museum entrance and we made our way to the Japan gallery just liike we had discussed back at school here we were given phones to take picutres of different things that relate to our object.</p>

<p>My object was a star wars figurine. So i suggested that i find something that was linked with fighting, this would help because my object fights  a lot. I picked some warriors armour so this would represent that he was linked with fighting. After i went into photoshop and started to play around with the tools and it ended up like this!</p>
